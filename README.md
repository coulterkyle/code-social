## Description

This project produced a backend to a social media website that allows users to be created, found, updated and deleted, user freinds to be added and removed, user's thoughts to be created, read, updated and deleted, and reactions to those thoughts to be created and deleted.
The motivation behind this app was to produce a product would serve as a social media backend.
By completing this project I was able to demonstrate noSQL and mongoDB principals I learned in bootcamp coding class.
